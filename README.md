# RailwayStationsWorkload
**Version of server that allows to make calls from browser**
Developing of such thing was inspired to created to help my friend with their research.

**For now there are two methonds available:**

-Scrapping workload for required station(s) with option to store the collected data to redis(With possible idea to store workload with specifying day when it was added and stored for analyzing it as time series.

-Retrieving values from Redis itself for required stations

**For now this is just a single monolith server**
